# Q4.2 Can you reject the null hypothesis?

p=0.2049 
If critical value alpha p<0.05 then the null hypothesis can be rejected.
In our data set, p=0.2049 hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
The cut off can also be taken as p<0.01 or p<0.001. But with p value being
more than the critical alpha, we cannot reject the hypothesis with 95% 
confidence. 

# Q4.3 Can you reject the null hypothesis?

p=0.0932
If critical value alpha p<0.05 then the null hypothesis can be rejected.
In our data set, p=0.0932 hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
The cut off can also be taken as p<0.01 or p<0.001. But with p value being
more than the critical alpha, we cannot reject the hypothesis with 95% 
confidence.

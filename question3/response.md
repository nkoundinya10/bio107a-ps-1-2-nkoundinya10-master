# Q3.2 Can you reject the null hypothesis?

p=0.0123
If critical value alpha p<0.05 then the null hypothesis can be rejected.
In our data set, p=0.0123 hence we can reject the null hypothesis.
The cut off can also be taken as p<0.01 or p<0.001. But with p value being
less than the critical alpha, we can reject the hypothesis with 95% 
confidence. 

# Q3.3 Can you reject the null hypothesis?
p=0.0061
If critical value alpha p<0.05 then the null hypothesis can be rejected.
In our data set, p=0.0061 hence we can reject the null hypothesis.
The cut off can also be taken as p<0.01 or p<0.001. But with p value being
less than the critical alpha, we can reject the hypothesis with 95% 
confidence.
